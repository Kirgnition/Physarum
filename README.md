# Physarum

Physarum is a simulation of the transport network mechanisms shown by the *Physarum Polycephalum* slime mold built using C++ and [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).

I decided to pursue this project after reaading [this paper](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579) and seeing how such complex behaviours arise from a simple rule followed by every particle in the simulation.


## Usage

From the project root folder, compile it by executing 

```bash
make
```
Then run it using
```bash
make run
```
